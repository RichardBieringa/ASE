# Article Search Engine

ASE is a tool to find articles and publications from well known sources. The tool is inspired to easily create a list of indexable articles which we are able to query on metadata and perform basic analysis on. This tool is created to allow a user to systematically search papers and publications to include in a literature survey.

The tool is created for a survey in the Computer Science field and therefore the sources are selected as such. The tool is essentially a simple hack in order to find papers and store the metadata.
